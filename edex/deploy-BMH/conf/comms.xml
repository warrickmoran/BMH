<!-- This file contains all the configurable parameters used by the BMH Comms 
  Manager. This file is written by edex whenever the configuration changes. 
  Edex will overwrite any values in dac elements or the jmsConnection element if
  they are not consistent with the current edex configuration. All other fields
  are preserved. The comms manager watches this file for changes and immediately
  rereads it. The configuration is immediately propogated to any dac transmit
  processes that are currently running. -->

<!-- The root of the config contains ports to listen on for connections from 
  other processes.
  
  The lineTapPort is used by the BMH UI to listen to what is currently being
  broadcast on the dacs and must be consistent with what is in 
  bmh-request.properties.
  
  The dacTransmitPort, this port is passed to each dac transmit on startup, 
  however if there are existing dac transmit processes care should be taken
  because when this is changed they may not be able to communicate with any
  new comms manager processes.
  
  The clusterPort is used to communicate with other clusterHosts and must be
  consistent for all cluster members. -->
